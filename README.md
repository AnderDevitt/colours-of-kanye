## Purpose of the application

The purpose of the Colours of Kanye application is to generate a colour scheme of complimentary colours for web design projects, and to make you laugh your **CENSORED WORD** off.

Many of us have not studied colour or design, and may have trouble choosing colours that will work together in our projects. The app will randomly generate a pallet with three complementary colours.

## Feature list

- **Random Colour Pallet Generater**: This feature uses two APIs. First, a random colour is generated in one API. This colour is then passed to the second API, which matches it with two other colours which should complement it when used together.

- **Kanye Quotes**: The app will receive and display 5 random quotes from the Kanye Rest API and display them on the page. Why? Because we all need a laugh when we're busy, and Kanye is cooler than cat videos. We're sure you'll agree after using our site.

- **Naughty Word Filter**: We needed to make this PG. So we've coded a filter to check each quote and replace the words we can't print in class with some funny options.

- **Random Kanye Images**: Each quote is acompanied by a random Kanye image to enhance your enjoyment and brighten your day.

- **Get Inspired by Kanye**: We did. You will.

## Things we learned from this project

### Git and GitHub

We have learnt a lot the last two days about using source control when working as a team. Using Trello to organise our work, we created tickets with randomized ticket-numbers for tasks, then our working branches with the numbers and descriptions for the tasks.

We also got used to solving mistakes (like accidentally working in the main branch) and managing conflicts when making pull requests. It was also very interesting reviewing and discussing everyone's code before merging.
